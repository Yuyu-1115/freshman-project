# Freshman Project
This is a project built for the course CE1004B（計算機實習II）. We're attempting to make a game inspired from Vampire Survivors and Balatro. More details will be added as the project continues.
## Build From Source
Currently, you have to build from source if you want to test out, run the following command to build/run the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuyu-1115/freshman-project.git
cd freshman-project
./gradlew run # swap to build if you want to build the project
```
The project runs on Java 21, so make sure you have the SDK installed.
